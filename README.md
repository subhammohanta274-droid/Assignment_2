# Task 1 - A Python code which Checks if a Number is Even or Odd

------FUNCTIONALITY------

• The program asks the user to put an interger number.
• It uses Python's input() function to take the input from the user.
• The entered number is converted into a interger using int().
• An --[if-else]-- statement checks this condition( num % 2 == 0 ) is True or False.
• If the condition is True then the "if" statement is printed , means the given number is even.
• If the condition is False then the "else" statement is printed , means the given number is odd.



# Task 2 - A Python code which gives Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 using Loop

------FNCTIONALTY------

1 - total = 0
• This line create a variable --[total]-- to store the sum of numbers.
• At first, it is set to 0 because we haven't added any numbers yet.

2 - for numbers in range(1,51):
• This loop runs from number 1 to 50.
• (numbers) takes each value in sequence one by one.

3 - total += numbers
• This means (total = total + numbers)
• Each number(numbers) is added to the running sum (total)

4 - print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: {total}")
• After the loop finishes, the program prints the final sum.
• The ouptput will be - The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
